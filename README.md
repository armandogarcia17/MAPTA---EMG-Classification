# Introduction to Machine Learning using Bio Signals

Are you new to Machine and Deep Learning and want to learn how to apply these techniques in your work? Machine learning is a data analytics technique that teaches computers to do what comes naturally to humans and animals: learn from experience. Machine learning algorithms use computational methods to learn information directly from data without relying on a predetermined equation as a model.  MATLAB provides an environment that allows you to apply advanced ML and DL techniques without requiring extensive coding or machine learning experience.

In this repository, you will find live scripts showcasing how to train, compare, and apply multiple Machine Learning (ML) algorithms on real Electromyogram datasets.
